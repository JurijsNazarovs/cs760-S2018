# Problem 2. PR curve
Image below represents PR curves for both methods: n - Naive Bayesian and
t - TAN. Threshold for this plot was defined in every point.

## Performance comparison
We notice that a PR curve corresponding to a TAN method is higher than the
curve for NB for almost all threshold points. Based on this reason we might
think that TAN perfomra better. However, fact that point (1,1) is 
considered as a best, and curve closes(t to this point represents a
better method. In that case we might think that NB performs better, since 
at the point (0.87, 0.87) n curve is the closest to (1,1).

Thus, it is hard to say which one is better and maybe it is worth
to conduct a statistical test (e.g. paired t-test).

## Advantages and disadvantages of ROC versus PR curves  
The advantave of both curves is that they allow to measure a predictive
perfomance of classifier. However, there is an assumption about boinary
classification.

### ROC  
[a] insensitive to changes in class distribution  
[a] can identify optimal classification threshold for tasks with 
differential missclassification costs

### PR
[a] well suited for tasks with lots of negative instances  
[a] show the fraction of predictions that are dalse positives

### Relation to our data
Important to notice that the assumption about binary classification problem is still valid in our data. So, we can apply both of them. We have 81
positive samples in our training set and 61 negatives. Which does not 
give any priorities to any of these curves. However, in our task it is important to uderstand which which class to assign the data. And we for sure do not want to missclassify metastases. Thus, I would chose PR curve 
as an assesment curve of the performance in our model.

# Problem 3. Accuracy testing
To answer the question whether two methods have same performance, we are using pared t-test, with null hypothesis that test have same performance.
Important to notice that paired t-test helps to understand if performance
of methods is the same, but not which method perfor better.

$\delta = x_n - x_t$, where $x_n$ - performace of Naive Bayes method and 
$x_t$ - performacne of TAN. Perfomance in our test is measured by accuracy.
Since we consider paired t-test, the formula for t-statistic is following:

$$t = \frac{\bar \delta}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n(n - 1)} \sum {(\delta_i - \bar \delta)^2}}}$$

From the analysis we have: $n = 10$, $\bar \delta = 0.0362$, and $t = 0.0860$. 

We consider the t-test with significant level of $\alpha = 0.05$. 
Since we are working on pairwise t-test, corresponding p-value is with 
parameters $\alpha/2 = 0.025$, and degrees of freedom $n - 1 = 9$.

P-value corresponing to observed t-statistics $t = 0.0860$ is 0.9333493 (do not forget to multiply by two, since it is 2-sided test).
Which is much higher than 0.05, and consequenty we cannot reject null
hypothesis that methods have the same performance.

That is, we conclude that method have the same performance.
